      - DC can use: Tier contribution percentages
    - **OFFSET METHOD** (subtract SS): Reduce promised benefit by portion of Social Security
      - DB can use: Has promised benefit to reduce
      - DC CANNOT use: No promised benefit to offset!
    - **Memory aid**: "DC has No Offset, DB can do Both"
    - **Key rule**: DC plans can only use excess method (can't offset what doesn't exist)
  - **Cash Balance Plans** (2025-10-23) - MASTERED:
    - **The "Hybrid" Plan**: DB plan that looks like DC to employees
    - **CAN have vesting schedules** (3-year cliff OR 6-year graded)

      - Both: Death, disability, medical >7.5% AGI, SEPP/72(t)
      - IRA ONLY: Education, first home ($10K), health insurance (unemployed), IRS levy
      - 401(k) ONLY: Rule of 55 (age 55+ separation)
    - **"HIDES" mnemonic for IRA exceptions**:
      - H = Higher education (qualified expenses)
      - I = Insurance (health premiums if unemployed 12+ weeks)
      - D = Disability
      - E = Excessive medical (>7.5% AGI)

- [x] **F.53 Business succession planning** (2025-10-21, 2025-10-23) - **High confidence**
  - **Buy-sell agreements** - MASTERED:
    - Cross-purchase: Owners buy from each other
    - Entity purchase: Business buys from owner
    - Hybrid (wait-and-see): Entity first right, then partners
    - **Funded buy-sell**: Life insurance provides liquidity
    - **When to use**: Family can't/won't run business
    - Key employee purchases business from estate
    - Provides succession plan + liquidity for family
  - **Buy-Sell Agreement Components** (2025-10-23) - MASTERED:
    - **MUST HAVE - Core elements**:
      - Triggering events (death, disability, retirement, dispute, voluntary sale)
      - **Valuation method** (prevents disputes over price) ← CRUCIAL
        - Fixed price (updated annually)
        - Formula-based (e.g., 5x EBITDA, book value multiple)
        - Independent appraisal
        - Combination approach
      - Funding mechanism (life insurance, sinking fund, installments)
      - Purchase obligation (must buy vs may buy)
      - First right of refusal provisions
      - Transfer restrictions
    - **SHOULD HAVE - Family protection**:
      - **Trust establishment** (manages transaction, protects family) ← CRUCIAL
        - Trust owns shares or receives insurance proceeds
        - Professional trustee handles buyout
        - Removes emotion from transaction
        - Clear distribution plan for family
    - **NOT IN BUY-SELL AGREEMENT** (common trap):
      - ❌ Roles and responsibilities (goes in operating agreement)
      - ❌ Job descriptions (employment contracts)
      - ❌ Management succession plan (separate document)
      - ❌ CEO transition timeline (succession roadmap)
      - **Key distinction**: Buy-sell = OWNERSHIP transfer, NOT management structure
    - **AVOID**:
      - ❌ Asset exclusions (creates ambiguity and future disputes)
      - Keep agreement comprehensive and clear
    - Perfect on practice problem (valuation + trust, not roles) ✓
  - **Business structures for succession**:
    - When family involved: FLP, voting/non-voting stock, GRAT
    - When family NOT involved: Buy-sell to key employee or third party
  - ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)
  - Disability buy-out insurance
  - **Practical application**: Match tools to client situation (family capability/willingness)
  - **In slides**: Pages 175-182

## G. Estate Planning (10%)

**Slides**: Estate (200 pages comprehensive)

### ✅ Mastered Topics (9/14)

- [x] **G.54 Property titling** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-19) - **High confidence**
  - Probate vs non-probate assets
  - JTWROS (avoids probate)
  - Tenants in common (goes through probate)
  - Life insurance beneficiary strategies (to person vs to estate)
  - **JTWROS Estate Tax Treatment** (2025-10-19) - MASTERED:
    - Included in gross estate for estate tax (IRC § 2040) ✓
    - 50% included for spouses, 100% for non-spouses (unless prove contribution)
    - Avoids PROBATE but NOT estate tax ✓
    - Common trap: "avoids probate" ≠ "avoids estate tax"
  - **Step-Up Basis Rules**:
    - JTWROS: 50% step-up (spouses in common law states)
    - Community Property: 100% step-up (both halves)
    - TIC: Only deceased's % gets step-up
  - **Memory System Created**: "3 P's Test" (Probate, Pass, Percentage)
  - **In slides**: Pages 20-40

- [x] **G.55 Strategies to transfer property** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **Self-Canceling Installment Note (SCIN)** - MASTERED:
    - Seller sells property to buyer for installment note
    - If seller dies before note paid off, remaining payments CANCELLED
    - **Perfect for shortened life expectancy**: High probability of dying during term
    - Provides cash flow during life + estate tax savings
    - SCIN premium (slightly higher price) compensates for cancellation risk
    - **Textbook use case**: Person with health issues/shortened life expectancy
  - **Private annuity contracts**:
    - Transfer property for lifetime payments
    - Unsecured obligation
    - With shortened life expectancy: Actuarially valued higher (bad for buyer)
  - **When to use SCIN vs Private Annuity**:
    - SCIN: Shortened life expectancy (seller likely dies during term)
    - Private Annuity: Normal life expectancy, need lifetime income
  - **GRIT limitations**: Doesn't work for family members (IRC §2702)
  - **In slides**: Pages 70-85
  - **Note**: Compared to FLP (long time horizon) and GRIT (non-family only)

- [x] **G.57 Gift, estate, and GST tax compliance and calculation** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **Annual Exclusion Gifting** - MASTERED:
    - Per donor, per donee, per year
    - 2023: $17,000, 2024: $18,000, 2025: $19,000 (projected)
    - Married couples: Each spouse can give separately
    - Can give to children AND their spouses (separate donees)
    - Example: 2 parents × 4 recipients × $17K = $136K annual gifts
    - "Without using applicable exclusion" = stay within annual limits
  - **Gross Estate Calculation** - MASTERED:
    - **3-Year Lookback Rule (IRC §2035)**:
      - Life insurance transferred within 3 years of death → included in estate
      - Prevents deathbed transfers to avoid estate tax
      - Must transfer >3 years before death for ILIT to work
      - If transfer <3 years: Death benefit included in gross estate
    - **JTWROS Estate Tax Treatment (IRC §2040)**:
      - Spouses: 50% included in deceased's gross estate
      - Non-spouses: 100% unless prove contribution
      - Avoids probate but NOT estate tax
    - **Formula**: Add up all includible assets
  - **Lifetime Exclusion**: $13.61M (2024), adjusts for inflation
  - **In slides**: Pages 50-120 (most comprehensive estate section)
  - **Key distinction**: Annual exclusion vs lifetime exemption

- [x] **G.58 Sources for estate liquidity** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **IRC Section 6166 - Installment Payment of Estate Tax** - MASTERED:
    - Pay estate tax over 14 years for family business owners
    - Interest-only for first 4-5 years, then principal + interest
    - Special low interest rate (2% on first $1.7M)
    - Requirements: Closely-held business >35% of adjusted gross estate
    - **Perfect for**: Family business owners with illiquid estates
    - Prevents forced sale of business to pay estate taxes
  - **Immediate Liquidity Sources**:
    - Life insurance death benefit (if estate is beneficiary)
    - Cash and checking accounts
    - Stocks and bonds (sell within days/weeks)
    - Money market accounts
  - **NOT Immediate Liquidity**:
    - Borrowing (complex, slow, creates new debt)
    - Rental income (ongoing, not lump sum)
  - **NOT Estate Liquidity**:
    - Retirement accounts with beneficiaries (bypass estate)
    - Life insurance with beneficiaries (bypass estate)
  - **Critical Distinction**: Estate assets vs. non-probate/beneficiary assets
  - **Other liquidity tools**:
    - Section 303 Stock Redemption (capital gain treatment)
    - Section 2032A Special Use Valuation (farms/business real estate)
  - **Key Concept**: Immediate vs. medium-term vs. ongoing liquidity sources
  - **In slides**: Pages 150-165

- [x] **G.59 Types, features, and taxation of trusts** (2025-10-20 voice, 2025-10-21) - **Medium-High confidence**
  - **Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRT)**:
    - CRAT (Annuity): Fixed dollar amount annually, remainder to charity
    - CRUT (Unitrust): Percentage of value (varies), remainder to charity
    - Income to donor/beneficiaries during life, remainder to CHARITY
  - **Grantor Retained Trusts (GRT)**:
    - GRAT (Annuity): Fixed payment to grantor, remainder to FAMILY
    - GRUT (Unitrust): Percentage payment to grantor, remainder to FAMILY
    - Key difference from CRT: Remainder goes to beneficiaries, not charity
  - **QPRT (Qualified Personal Residence Trust)** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - Transfer residence to trust, retain right to live there for X years
    - After term, residence passes to beneficiaries
    - Gift = FMV of home - PV of retained interest
    - **Maximum of TWO QPRTs** (principal residence + one other)
    - **AFR effect**: Higher AFR → Lower PV of retained interest
    - **Term length effect**: Shorter term → Higher gift (less retained interest)
    - **Planning tradeoff**: Shorter term (safer, higher gift) vs Longer term (riskier, lower gift)
    - Must survive term or property comes back into estate
    - Gift occurs at CREATION, not termination
  - **Charitable Lead Trust (CLT)**:
    - Opposite of CRT: Income to CHARITY first, remainder to FAMILY later
  - **Pooled Income Fund**:
    - Simpler charitable giving vehicle, managed by charity
    - Income to donor, remainder to charity
  - **QTIP (Qualified Terminable Interest Property Trust)**:
    - Marital deduction trust for surviving spouse
    - Spouse gets income for life, grantor controls remainder (often kids from first marriage)
    - Estate tax deferred until second spouse dies
  - **QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust)**:
    - For non-citizen spouse to preserve marital deduction
    - US trustee requirement
    - Estate tax deferred until distributions or death
  - **ABC Trust Structure**:
    - A Trust (Bypass/Applicable Exclusion): Uses deceased's estate tax exemption
    - C Trust (Marital/QTIP): Surviving spouse's assets, gets marital deduction
    - Less common now due to portability of estate tax exemption
  - **ILIT (Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust)**:
    - Transfer life insurance to remove from estate
    - **3-year rule applies**: Must transfer >3 years before death
    - If <3 years: Death benefit included in gross estate anyway
  - **Key Framework**: "Who gets what" - income recipient vs remainder recipient
  - **Memory Aid Created**: CRAT/CRUT → Charity Remainder, GRAT/GRUT → Grantor Retained
  - **CRT 4-Tier Taxation** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - **Not** a basis calculation like annuities!
    - **Tier 1: Ordinary Income** (worst first) - interest, non-qual dividends, rent, business income
    - **Tier 2: Capital Gains** - STCG then LTCG
    - **Tier 3: Tax-Exempt Income** - municipal bond interest
    - **Tier 4: Return of Principal** - only after ALL income distributed
    - Each payment uses FIFO ordering (exhausts each tier before moving to next)
    - Preserves character of income (prevents ordinary→capital conversion)
  - **Irrevocable Trust Estate Tax & Income Tax** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - Creating irrevocable trust removes assets from grantor's estate (estate tax savings)
    - **DNI (Distributable Net Income) Rules**:
      - Income distributed → beneficiaries pay income tax
      - Income retained → trust pays income tax (at higher rates)
    - Trade-off: Estate tax savings vs. loss of step-up in basis
    - Property in irrevocable trust gets carryover basis, not step-up at death
  - **In slides**: Pages 130-170
  - **Note**: Student expressed difficulty remembering acronyms, needs reinforcement

- [x] **G.60 Marital deduction** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust)** - MASTERED:
    - For non-citizen spouse to get marital deduction
    - **Problem without QDOT**: Marital deduction ONLY for U.S. citizen spouses
    - **Solution**: QDOT enables unlimited marital deduction for non-citizen spouse
    - **Estate tax deferred, not eliminated**:
      - No estate tax at first spouse's death (marital deduction applies)
      - Estate tax due on principal distributions to surviving spouse
      - Estate tax due at surviving spouse's death (on remaining assets)
    - **Income distributions**: NO estate tax (just income tax)
    - **Requirements**:
      - U.S. trustee (citizen or domestic corporation)
      - U.S. trustee can withhold estate tax on distributions
      - Irrevocable election on estate tax return
    - **Key distinction**: Non-citizen spouse does NOT become "domestic"
      - Still non-citizen, still gets different treatment than U.S. citizen spouse
      - QDOT is a workaround, not equivalence
  - **QTIP (Qualified Terminable Interest Property)**:
    - Marital deduction trust for surviving spouse
    - Spouse gets income for life
    - Grantor controls remainder (often kids from first marriage)
    - Estate tax deferred until second spouse dies
  - **Unlimited marital deduction**: No limit on gifts/bequests to U.S. citizen spouse
  - **Terminable interest rule**: Property that terminates doesn't qualify (unless QTIP)
  - **In slides**: Pages 50-70

- [x] **G.64 Special needs planning** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **Special Needs Trust (SNT)** - MASTERED:
    - Preserves government benefits (SSI, Medicaid)
    - Provides supplemental care without disqualifying from benefits

  - Crisis planning considerations
  - **In slides**: Brief mention throughout estate slides

### ✅ Mastered Topics (2/6)

- [x] **H.66 Behavioral finance** (2025-10-20) - **High confidence**

    - **F**ollow (Herd) - copy others despite disagreement
    - **F**irst (Anchoring) - stuck on initial information
