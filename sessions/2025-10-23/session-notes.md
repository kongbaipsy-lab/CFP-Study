## Practice Problems Completed

### Question 1: Traditional IRA Deductibility - Non-Active Participant Spouse (F.49)

**Topic**: F.49 Non-qualified plan rules - Retirement Planning domain (18% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Sarah (45, married filing jointly, no retirement plan at work) and Mark (earns $140K, has 401(k)). Combined income $225K. Maximum IRA deduction for Sarah in 2024?

**Options**:
- A) $0 - Cannot deduct
- B) $7,000 - Full deductibility ✓
- C) Partially deductible
- D) $8,000 - Including catch-up

**Student's Answer**: B ✓ **CORRECT**

**Correct Answer**: **B) $7,000 - Full deductibility**

**Sarah's Situation**:
- She is NOT an active participant (no retirement plan at work)
- Spouse Mark IS an active participant (has 401(k))
- This triggers special non-active participant spousal phase-out rules

**2024 Phase-Out Ranges - Critical to Know**:

**1. Active Participant - Single/HOH**:
- Phase-out: $77,000 - $87,000

**2. Active Participant - MFJ**:
- Phase-out: $123,000 - $143,000

**3. Non-Active Participant (spouse is active) - MFJ**:
- Phase-out: **$230,000 - $240,000** ← Sarah's situation!

**The Calculation**:
- Combined MAGI: $225,000
- $225,000 < $230,000 (below phase-out start)
- **Full $7,000 deduction** ✓

**Why Not $8,000**:
- Catch-up contribution ($1,000 extra) only at **age 50+**
- Sarah is 45 → only $7,000 maximum

**Key Learning**:
- Three different phase-out ranges depending on participant status
- Non-active participant with active spouse has MUCH higher phase-out ($230K-$240K vs $123K-$143K)
- Age 50+ needed for catch-up contributions

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student immediately identified correct answer and reasoning

### Question 2: Medicaid Waiver Programs for Eldercare (C.21 / F.46)

**Topics**: C.21 Long-term care planning, F.46 Eldercare and special needs planning

**Problem Given**: Judy's father recently diagnosed with dementia, lives alone, needs help with daily activities. Judy has limited resources and income. What should CFP® professional recommend?

**Options**:
- A) Purchasing life insurance policy
- B) Applying for Medicaid Waiver programs ✓
- C) Considering long-term care insurance policy
- D) Establishing comprehensive medical trust fund

**Student's Initial Thinking**:
- ✓ Correctly identified: Father already has dementia → can't get LTC insurance
- ✓ Correctly identified: Life insurance doesn't solve immediate care needs
- ✓ Correctly identified: Limited resources → can't fund comprehensive trust
- ❓ Didn't know what Medicaid Waiver programs are

**Correct Answer**: **B) Applying for Medicaid Waiver programs**

**What Are Medicaid Waiver Programs?**

**Official Name**: HCBS (Home and Community-Based Services) Waiver Programs

**The Problem They Solve**:
- Medicaid traditionally only pays for nursing home care (institutional)
- Waiver programs "waive" the institutional requirement
- Allow people to receive care at home instead

**What They Provide**:
- Personal care assistance (bathing, dressing, eating)
- Adult day care
- Respite care (gives family caregivers breaks)
- Home modifications
- Meal delivery
- Care coordination

**Who Qualifies**:
- Must meet nursing home level of care criteria
- Must meet Medicaid income/asset limits
- Father with dementia needing daily help = **perfect candidate**

**Cost**: FREE or very low cost (Medicaid-funded)

**Income/Asset Limits** (2024 approximate):
- Income: ~$2,829/month (varies by state)
- Assets: ~$2,000 individual, ~$3,000 couple
- Excludes primary home and one vehicle
- "Limited resources" = likely qualifies

**Why Other Options Wrong**:

**A) Life Insurance**: ❌
- Father already has dementia = uninsurable or very expensive
- Life insurance pays at DEATH, not for current care
- Doesn't solve immediate problem

**C) Long-Term Care Insurance**: ❌
- **Cannot purchase after dementia diagnosis**
- Pre-existing condition exclusion
- Even if somehow approved, premiums astronomical
- Student correctly identified this!

**D) Comprehensive Medical Trust Fund**: ❌
- Requires significant assets to fund
- "Limited resources and income" = not feasible
- Student correctly identified this!

**LTC Planning Timeline**:
```
Healthy → ✓ Buy LTC insurance (best time!)
    ↓
Early symptoms → Maybe coverage (very expensive)
    ↓
Diagnosed (dementia) → ❌ TOO LATE for insurance
    ↓
Need care NOW → ✓ Medicaid Waiver Programs!
```

**Father is here** ↑ (diagnosed + needs help NOW)

**When to Recommend Medicaid Waivers**:
- Client needs care immediately
- Limited financial resources
- Wants to stay at home (not nursing facility)
- Meets level of care requirements

**CFP Professional's Role**:
- Identify Medicaid Waiver as option
- Refer to elder law attorney for application help
- Explain state-specific programs (each state different)
- Warn about potential waiting lists (apply early!)

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student had excellent critical thinking on what DOESN'T work, learned new concept (Medicaid Waivers)

### Question 3: Safe Harbor 401(k) vs Defined Benefit Plan Selection (F.47, F.48)

**Topics**: F.47 Types of retirement plans, F.48 Qualified plan rules

**Problem Given**: Marko owns IT consultancy with 15 employees. Wants:
1. Flexible employer contributions
2. Encourages employee retention
3. Maximize retirement savings for himself (near retirement age)

**Options**:
- A) Defined Benefit Plan
- B) SEP IRA
- C) Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan ✓
- D) Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan

**Student's Initial Thinking**:
- Correctly ruled out NQDC (not for all employees)
- Correctly ruled out SEP (immediate vesting = no retention)
- Stuck between Safe Harbor 401(k) and Defined Benefit
- Leaning toward DB because "maximizes owner savings"

**Correct Answer**: **C) Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan**

**The KEY Word**: "**Flexible** employer contributions"

**Why Defined Benefit FAILS**:

**Fatal Flaw - NOT FLEXIBLE**:
- Actuarially determined contributions REQUIRED every year
- Must fund promised benefit regardless of profits
- Bad year? Still must contribute!
- Good year? Might contribute MORE than wanted

**Example of DB Inflexibility**:
- Year 1: Business great, contributes $200K ✓
- Year 2: Business slow, must contribute $195K ✗ (no choice!)
- Year 3: Business terrible, must contribute $190K ✗✗ (forced!)

**"Flexible" ≠ Defined Benefit** ← KEY EXAM PATTERN

**Why Safe Harbor 401(k) WORKS**:

**Structure**:
- **Safe Harbor portion**: 3% non-elective OR 4% match (required minimum)
- **PLUS**: Discretionary profit-sharing on top (0-25%)

**Marko's Objectives - Perfect Match**:

**1. Flexible employer contributions**: ✅
- Safe Harbor: 3% required (small, manageable base)
- Profit-sharing: 0-25% DISCRETIONARY (truly flexible!)
- Good year: Add big profit-sharing
- Bad year: Just 3% safe harbor minimum

**2. Employee retention**: ✅
- Profit-sharing portion CAN have vesting schedule (2-6 years)
- Employees stay to get vested
- Safe harbor immediate, but profit-sharing vests

**3. Maximize owner savings**: ✅
- Owner can contribute $69K total:
  - $23K employee deferral
  - $46K employer contribution (safe harbor + profit sharing)
- Not as high as DB ($275K), but still excellent

**Bonus Advantages**:
- No discrimination testing (ADP/ACP tests waived)
- Owner can max out easily
- Simpler administration than DB

**Year-by-Year Flexibility Example**:

**Good Year** (profits $500K):
- Safe Harbor: 3% × payroll = $45K
- Profit-sharing: 15% × payroll = $225K
- Total: $270K
- Owner share: ~$69K max

**Bad Year** (profits $100K):
- Safe Harbor: 3% × payroll = $45K (required)
- Profit-sharing: **0%** (skip it!)
- Total: $45K only
- Owner share: ~$25K

**Flexibility achieved!** ✓

**Why Other Options Wrong**:

**A) Defined Benefit Plan**: ❌
- ✓ Maximizes savings: YES ($275K possible)
- ✓ Employee retention: YES (vesting)
- ❌ **Flexible contributions: NO** (actuarially required)
- Violates #1 objective

**B) SEP IRA**: ❌
- ✓ Flexible: YES (0-25% discretionary)
- ✓ Maximize savings: OKAY ($69K)
- ❌ **Employee retention: NO** (100% immediate vesting required)
- Violates #2 objective

**D) NQDC**: ❌
- Only for select employees (executives)
- Not for all 15 full-time employees
- Doesn't fit company-wide retirement plan

**CFP Exam Pattern Learned**:
- "Flexible employer contributions" → rules out DB plans
- DB = actuarially determined = NOT flexible
- Look for Safe Harbor 401(k) or Profit-Sharing with discretion

**Understanding Level**: VERY GOOD - Student identified the right tension, learned the "flexible" clue rules out DB

### Question 4: Defined Contribution vs Defined Benefit Classification (F.47)

**Topic**: F.47 Types of retirement plans - Classification

**Problem Given**: Small engineering firm lists retirement plans. Which of the following **DEFINED CONTRIBUTION** plans should be considered?

**Firm's List**:
1. Traditional 401(k) Plan
2. Defined Benefit Pension Plan
3. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
4. Profit-Sharing Plan
5. Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA

**Options**:
- A) Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan
- B) Traditional 401(k) Plan ✓
- C) Defined Benefit Pension Plan
- D) Profit-Sharing Plan ✓

**Student's Initial Thinking**:
- "Defined benefit allows most significant contribution so I choose that"
- Focused on which allows HIGHEST contributions
- Missed that question asks for DC classification

**Correct Answer**: **B and D** (both are DC plans)

If forced to choose ONE: **D) Profit-Sharing Plan** (because question emphasized "more significant contributions" and profit-sharing is 100% employer-funded)

**The Critical Distinction - DC vs DB**:

**Defined Contribution (DC) Plans**:
- **Contribution is DEFINED** (known amount going in)
- Benefit is NOT defined (depends on investment returns)
- Individual accounts for each employee
- Examples: 401(k), 403(b), Profit-Sharing, SEP, SIMPLE
- Maximum: $69,000 (2024)

**Defined Benefit (DB) Plans**:
- **Benefit is DEFINED** (promised amount at retirement)
- Contribution is NOT defined (actuarially determined)
- Pooled plan, no individual accounts
- Examples: Traditional pension, Cash Balance
- Maximum: $275,000 (2024)

**Analysis of Each Answer**:

**A) Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation**: ❌
- NOT a qualified plan at all
- Not DC, not DB - it's non-qualified
- Different category entirely

**B) Traditional 401(k) Plan**: ✅
- **Defined Contribution plan**
- Qualified plan
- From the firm's list

**C) Defined Benefit Pension Plan**: ❌
- **This IS a DB plan, NOT a DC plan!**
- Even though it allows higher contributions ($275K)
- Question specifically asks for DC plan
- Wrong classification!

**D) Profit-Sharing Plan**: ✅
- **Defined Contribution plan**
- Qualified plan
- From the firm's list
- 100% employer-funded (good for "significant contributions")

**The Student's Mistake**:
- Confused "what allows most money" with "what type of plan is it"
- Question asks: "Which is a DC plan?"
- Student answered: "Which allows most contribution?"
- Different questions!

**Analogy Provided**:
- Question: "Which of these is a CAR?"
  - A) Bicycle
  - B) Honda Civic
  - C) Boeing 747
  - D) Toyota Camry
- Wrong answer: "Boeing 747 carries most people" ✗
- Right answer: "Honda and Toyota are cars" ✓

**Why Profit-Sharing Might Be THE Answer**:
- Question mentions "more significant contributions to employee retirements"
- 401(k) relies on employee deferrals ($23K max)
- Profit-Sharing is 100% employer-funded (up to $69K)
- Better for employees who don't defer much

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student learned to read question carefully for classification vs. contribution amount

### Question 5: Cash Balance Plan for Employee Retention (F.48)

**Topic**: F.48 Qualified plan rules - Cash Balance plans, vesting

**Problem Given**: Manufacturing company, 15 employees, wants:
1. Employee retention
2. Predictable employer contributions
3. Maximize CEO contributions and deductibility

**Options**:
- A) SIMPLE IRA with employer match
- B) Traditional IRA for each employee
- C) Cash balance defined benefit plan ✓
- D) SEP IRA

**Student's Initial Thinking**:
- Narrowed to Cash Balance vs SEP IRA ✓ (good!)
- Said: "Cash Balance doesn't help with employee retention, nothing special about it"
- Missing the KEY vesting feature

**Correct Answer**: **C) Cash Balance Defined Benefit Plan**

**The Missing Piece - VESTING for Retention**:

**Cash Balance Plans CAN Have Vesting Schedules**:
- 3-year cliff vesting OR
- 6-year graded vesting (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%)

**How This Creates "Golden Handcuffs"**:

**Employee's View**:
- Year 1: Account shows $10,000 (0% vested) → "I need to stay!"
- Year 2: Account shows $21,000 (0% vested) → "Getting bigger!"
- Year 3: Account shows $33,000 (**100% vested!**) → "Now it's mine!"

**If employee leaves before Year 3**: Forfeits everything!

**This is POWERFUL employee retention** ✓

**Compare to SEP IRA**:
- ❌ **100% immediate vesting REQUIRED by law**
- ❌ No retention tool whatsoever
- Employee can leave Day 2 with all employer contributions
- No golden handcuffs

**Objective #1 - Employee Retention**:
- Cash Balance: ✅ YES (vesting schedules)
- SEP IRA: ❌ NO (immediate vesting required)

**Objective #2 - Predictable Contributions**:

**Cash Balance Structure**:
- Each employee gets: **5% pay credit + 4% interest credit** (example)
- Very predictable formula
- Employees see consistent annual credits

**Example**:
- Employee earns $60,000
- Year 1: $60,000 × 5% = $3,000 + 4% interest
- Year 2: $60,000 × 5% = $3,000 + 4% interest
- **Predictable account credits!** ✓

**Note**: Employer's actual contribution varies (actuarially determined), but account credits to employees are predictable

**SEP IRA**:
- Also predictable (e.g., 10% of pay each year)
- But no retention feature

**Objective #3 - Maximize CEO Contributions**:

**Cash Balance**:
- Can contribute **MUCH more than $69K**
- CEO age 55-60: Could contribute $150K-$250K/year
- All tax-deductible ✓
- Perfect for older owners near retirement

**SEP IRA**:
- Maximum $69,000 (2024)
- 25% of compensation limit
- Much lower than Cash Balance

**Why Other Options Wrong**:

**A) SIMPLE IRA**: ❌
- Immediate vesting (no retention)
- Low limits ($16K + $3.5K catch-up)
- Can't maximize CEO contributions
- Fails ALL three objectives

**B) Traditional IRA**: ❌
- Not an employer plan
- $7,000 per person limit
- No retention features
- Makes no sense for company plan

**D) SEP IRA**: ❌
- ✓ Predictable: YES
- ✓ Maximize CEO: OKAY ($69K)
- ❌ **Employee retention: NO** (immediate vesting)
- Missing objective #1!

**Cash Balance - The "Hybrid" Plan**:

**Why called hybrid**:
- Technically a **Defined Benefit plan**
- But **looks like DC plan** to employees (see account balances)

**Best of both worlds**:
- DB features: High contribution limits, vesting schedules, retention
- DC features: Portable account balance, easier for employees to understand

**Perfect for**:
- Small businesses with older owners (high contributions)
- Want employee retention (vesting)
- Stable business (can handle actuarial funding)

**Key Distinction Student Missed**:

**Cash Balance**:
- ✅ **CAN have vesting schedules** (3-year or 6-year)
- ✅ Golden handcuffs for retention
- ✅ High contribution limits
- ✅ Predictable account credits

**SEP IRA**:
- ❌ **MUST have 100% immediate vesting** (IRS rule)
- ❌ No retention tool
- ✓ Predictable contributions
- ✓ Decent limits ($69K)

**The "employee retention" objective eliminates SEP IRA!**

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student initially missed vesting feature, but understood once explained. This is a critical F.48 concept.

- For people already needing care (after diagnosis)
- Low/no cost, Medicaid-funded
- When LTC insurance too late (after diagnosis)

### Retirement Plan Selection Patterns (F.47, F.48)
- **"Flexible contributions"** → Rules out DB plans (actuarially required)
- **"Employee retention"** → Need vesting schedules (rules out SEP, SIMPLE)
- **"Maximize owner contributions"** → DB plans or high DC limits
- Safe Harbor 401(k) = base requirement + discretionary profit-sharing

### Cash Balance Plans (F.48)
- Hybrid: DB plan that looks like DC to employees
- **CAN have vesting schedules** (3-year cliff or 6-year graded)
- Creates golden handcuffs for retention
- High contribution limits for older owners
- Predictable account credits for employees
- vs SEP IRA: SEP has immediate vesting (no retention)

### DC vs DB Classification (F.47)
- **DC**: Contribution defined, benefit depends on returns
- **DB**: Benefit defined, contribution actuarially determined
- Read question: asks for classification, not best plan or highest contribution
